- Docs, examples
- Provide a usage function for printing list of options
- Name of variable for parameters that will be displayed in usage eg. "--my-arg VAR"
- Use std::string instead of const char*?
- Remove empty categories
- Accept both "--my-arg x" and "--my-arg=x" style
- Keep track of argument position and make them comparable with operator < and >
- Use a hashmap instead of vector for storing options? Probably doesn't matter
